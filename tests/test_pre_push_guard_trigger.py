"""Tests for .githooks/pre-push's guard-managed-path trigger precision.

Regression matrix rows 1-2 from the ECC push-gate analysis (2026-08-14):
a helper script that merely lives under scripts/git/ (but isn't a manifest-
managed guard file) must never drag in the cross-worktree divergence scan;
a genuine manifest-managed guard-file change must still trigger it and fail
closed when a sibling has diverged.
