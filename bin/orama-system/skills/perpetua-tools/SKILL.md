description: "Top-level agent lifecycle and model-selection orchestrator for Perpetua-Tools: ModelRegistry, config/models.yml and routing.yml, the FastAPI /orchestrate endpoint, and file-based agent-instance/budget/queue state. Use when routing or selecting models for agent tasks, configuring orchestration, or working with Perpetua-Tools' dispatch layer. Don't use for reasoning methodology or AFRP/CIDF process questions -- that's orama-system's role, not this orchestrator's."

# perpetua-tools

This is a thin wrapper. The canonical skill lives in this repo at the path below
(resolve the repo root at runtime — paths are never hardcoded).

- Canonical skill path (repo-relative): `Perpetua-Tools/SKILL.md`

## Before Use

Before relying on the canonical card, check whether the canonical repository can safely sync:

```bash
ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
cd "$ROOT/Perpetua-Tools"
git fetch origin --prune
git status --short --branch
```

If the repo is on a tracking branch and the worktree is clean:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
```

If the worktree is dirty, the branch is not tracking origin, or fast-forward is impossible, do not overwrite local work. Report the drift and read the current canonical card with that caveat.

## Load Canonical Skill

Open and follow `Perpetua-Tools/SKILL.md` (relative to the repo root). Do not copy behavior from this wrapper.

## Windows UTF-8 Note

On Windows PowerShell, set UTF-8 explicitly before reading or writing skill files:

```powershell
[Console]::InputEncoding=[System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false)
[Console]::OutputEncoding=[System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false)
$OutputEncoding=[System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false)
$env:PYTHONUTF8='1'
```
